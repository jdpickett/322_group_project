## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
For this sprint we had a better game plan going into the sprint than we did for sprint 1. This made completing features more efficient and thus allowed us to get more feature done in the time frame. We did, however, come across a problem that slowed us down a little bit. During the first meeting we decided to do the "problems in different languages" feature. When we had started on the feature we did not realize how difficult of a feature it would be to implement. It was gonna take a lot more time than we anticipated to we decided to call it off for this sprint. We might come back to it later on or we might just scrap the entire feature. Other than that hang up for the sprint we were confident with the rest and was able to complete it without any other issues. 

## Unfinished Work
The "problems in different language" feature. It was just much more intensive than we thought as we would need to download stuff from a third party to be able to run other languages like python and c++ in a javascript file.
