## What's New (User Facing)
 * Login Page
 * Code IDE

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
The team started off by creating the github repository and setting up branches correctly. After this we got a firm understanding of what we wanted out of sprint 1 and decided what features we would be making for sprint 1. As this is the first time either of us had attempted to make a website we both had to do some research on how creating a website from scratch actually looks like. This was also our first time coding in html, css, and javascript so that was a hurdle we would have to overcome for sprint 1 so we could actually start the coding of our features. We decided to get the lgoin page and dashboard done first as those are the bare minimum essentials we needed to get started and then once those were done we add the ability to write code.
